# careerquestions
Simple Python code to query ChatGPT API about career possibilities based on your skills. 

To run locally, you must have python installed. Then simply run 'pip install openai' and 'python findcareer.py' 

OR you could try putting the code in Google Colab (colab.google.com) but I don't recommend that as much due to your API key from OpenAI potentially being exposed. 

It doesn't do anything fancy yet like save a chat session but I hope you find it useful.
