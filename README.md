# careerquestions
Simple Python code to query ChatGPT API about career possibilities based on your skills. 

To run locally, you must have python installed. Then simply run 'pip install openai' and 'python findcareer.py' 

If you don't have an API key from OpenAI to be able to access ChatGPT via API, get that here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/production-best-practices/api-keys 

It doesn't do anything fancy yet like save a chat session but I hope you find it useful. Eventually I think it would be fun to use as a template for a simple GUI app to learn more python myself.
